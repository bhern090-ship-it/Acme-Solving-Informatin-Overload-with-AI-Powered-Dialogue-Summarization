Acme Solving Informatin Overload with AI Powered Dialogue Summarization-Project 3
 Acme Summarizer: AI-Powered Dialogue Condensation
Acme Summarizer is a proof-of-concept (PoC) developed for Acme Communications to solve information overload in group chats. By leveraging a custom Encoder-Decoder Transformer architecture, this tool transforms lengthy, disorganized conversations into concise, human-readable summaries.
🚀 Business Value
Reduce Information Overload: Helps users catch up on missed conversations in seconds.
Boost Engagement: Makes high-volume group chats less intimidating and more accessible.
AI-Driven Innovation: Demonstrates the feasibility of integrating state-of-the-art NLP into the Acme platform.
🛠️ Technical Architecture
The model utilizes a "warm-started" Encoder-Decoder framework:
Encoder: bert-base-uncased — Responsible for deep contextual understanding of the chat dialogue.
Decoder: gpt2 — Responsible for generating fluent, abstractive summaries.
Dataset: SAMSum Corpus, featuring 16k+ messenger-style dialogues with human-annotated summaries.
⚡ Performance Optimizations
To ensure the prototype is fast and resource-efficient for 2026 standards, the following were implemented:
Dynamic Padding: Reduces computational waste by padding batches to the local maximum rather than a global fixed length.
Mixed Precision (FP16): Leverages GPU acceleration to cut training time by ~50%.
Sequence Length Tuning: Optimized input to 256 tokens to balance detail capture with processing speed.
📖 How It Works
1. Data Preparation
The pipeline tokenizes raw chat data, handles speaker labels, and prepares labels for supervised learning using the Hugging Face datasets library.
2. Training
The model is fine-tuned using Seq2SeqTrainer. This step is critical to training the cross-attention layers (the bridge between BERT and GPT-2) to ensure the decoder understands the encoder's output.
3. Inference
python
# Quick snippet to generate a summary
dialogue = "John: Meeting at 10? Mary: Yes, see you there!"
summary = generate_summary(dialogue)
print(summary) 
# Output: John and Mary confirmed their meeting for 10 AM.
Use code with caution.

📈 Evaluation
Performance is monitored via ROUGE metrics (ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L). These metrics ensure the AI's output maintains high overlap with human-authored summaries, prioritizing both key information and grammatical flow.
